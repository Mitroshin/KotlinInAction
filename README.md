Chapter 2: Kotlin Basics

    This chapter covers:
        * Declaring functions, variables, classes, enums ant properties
        * Control structures in Kotlin
        * Smart casts
        * Throwing and handing exceptions

    2.1 Basic elements: functions and variables
    
        2.1.1 Hello, world!
        
            -> example1
        
            * The "fun" keyword is used to declare a function
            * The parameter type is written after the parameter name
            * The function can be declare at t he top level of a file
            * Arrays are just classes
            * println() instead of System.out.println()
            * You can omit the semicolon "";" from the end of a line
            
        2.1.2 Functions
        
            -> example2
        
            The function declaration:
                * "fun" keyword
                * function name
                * parameter list in parentheses "()"
                * colon ":"
                * return type
        
            In Kotlin "if" is an expression with a result value. It's similar to a ternary operation in Java.
        
            -> example2.max1()
        
            Block body - if a function is written with its body in curly braces.
        
            -> example2.max2()
        
            Expression body - if a function returns an expression directly.
        
            -> example2.max3()
        
            For expression body functions, compiler can analyze the expression used as a the body of the
            function and use its type as the function return type.
            
        2.1.3 Variables
        
            -> example3
        
            You can omit type of variable or you may put the type after the variable name, but If a variable doesn't
            have an initializer, you need to specify its type explicitly.
        
            There are two keyword to declare a variable:
                * val (value) - Immutable reference. A "val" variable must be initialized exactly once during the
                    execution of the block where it's defined. But you can initialize it with different values depending
                    on some condition, if the compiler can ensure that only one of the initialization statement will be
                    executed. Even though a "val" reference is itself immutable, the object that it points to may be
                    mutable.
                * var (variable) - Mutable reference, but its type is fixed.
